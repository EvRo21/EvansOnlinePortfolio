      <p class="projecttxt box">The purpose of this project was to create a program that leads the robot from the starting position to the end. There are a total of nine grids split between my partner and I, so we both had to create one program that  works for four different grids. We decided to create different functions for each grid and when it runs it would call the grid that was given. One of the biggest problems we had was trying to make our code more abstract. Both our programs were very long to work for four grids. To solve this we created functions for repeated code and called those functions when the code was needed. My partner and I stayed in touch throughout the project to work on the problems and discuss possible changes in future sprints.</p>

      <p class="projecttxt2 box">The purpose of the project was to create an Escape Room with a Covid theme. My role in this project was to create the questions 3, 4 and to create the background function. My partner and I decided to create a storyline where the user has to climb a mountain to reach to Covid vaccine which is located at the top of the mountain. On the way to the top the user would have to pass obstacles or answer Covid related questions. My partner and I stayed in contact throughout the project to make sure we communicated any errors or changes we were making in the project. We faced many challenges while creating the escape room but the main problem was the questions being too hard. We brainstormed ways to fix this idea and decided to fix it by not changing the question but by adding a hint for question four and an alternate question for question 3. </p>
